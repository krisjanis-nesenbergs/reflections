When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So I can collaborate, have a remote backup and also use the repository from other computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the changes might conflict with stuff I am doing in a similar way, than merging of branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of a repository on Github directly without cloning locally, which leave a trace to the original for reference. Clones are the same repository on a different machine/place independent on github. branch is a different row of commits on the same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    No need to check online every time for status, but also it allows easy merges, because the previous state is known, in cases of conflict with remote changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Shared folder (problems vith version history) or another versioning system (SVN). Maybe even email. For each are harder and easier things.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When my changes are in need of discussion with other contributors online, who might or might not agree on them, so the master is kept clear and only updated when everyone is in agreement.
