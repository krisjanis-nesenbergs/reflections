How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Seeing where changes were actually made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Not worry about messing up, and experiment more, also see the history of changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can lose some work, if You forget to commit, but you can commit at meaningful times, making the history more coherent and easy to follow

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Depends on whether the file it self is self contained, or wheter it is a part of a project, all of which must match the file verson

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    WIth git log I can see the general versions and change descriptions, as well as statistics (--stat).  with diff I can compare two versions directly and see all changed lines

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can allways go back and see them and fix them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
